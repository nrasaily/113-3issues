<h1 class="text-center">About the Issue Manager</h1>
<div class="container mt-5 card shadow-lg p-4">

<p class="text-muted">An Issue Manager is a critical role in software development, IT operations, or project management, responsible for identifying, tracking, and resolving issues that arise during the project lifecycle. They ensure that any bugs, feature requests, technical problems, or workflow disruptions are logged in an issue-tracking system like Jira, GitHub Issues, or Trello. The Issue Manager acts as a bridge between the technical team and stakeholders, making sure that problems are prioritized based on severity and impact, assigned to the right team members, and resolved efficiently. Their goal is to maintain transparency, accountability, and consistent progress toward project goals.</p>

<p class="text-muted">In addition to overseeing issue resolution, an Issue Manager also facilitates regular meetings or reviews to monitor progress, updates stakeholders, and identifies patterns in recurring problems. They often work closely with QA testers, developers, and project managers to ensure timely fixes and prevent future issues by improving workflows or system processes. A well-organized Issue Manager contributes significantly to the overall quality, stability, and success of a project by minimizing delays and ensuring that nothing critical falls through the cracks.</p>
